//! Domain events for cross-module communication.
//!
//! Events carry full payloads so subscribers have everything they need without
//! secondary lookups. The broadcast channel clones each event per subscriber,
//! which is fine — richness beats round-trips.
//!
//! ## Workspace-scoped events
//!
//! Some events are scoped to a specific workspace directory and must be
//! validated by subscribers before acting on them.
//!
//! **Publisher contract**: when constructing a workspace-scoped event, the
//! publisher must populate `workspace_dir` with the active workspace path at
//! event creation time. This is typically available as `ctx.workspace_dir`
//! on the channel runtime context.
//!
//! **Subscriber contract**: subscribers that persist or mutate workspace-
//! specific data must compare the event's `workspace_dir` against their own
//! workspace binding and silently drop events that do not match. This prevents
//! stale in-flight events from a previous workspace from corrupting the newly
//! active workspace's state when the user switches workspaces (e.g. logs out
//! and back in) while events are in flight.
//!
//! **Current workspace-scoped variants**:
//! - [`DomainEvent::ChannelMessageReceived`]
//! - [`DomainEvent::ChannelMessageProcessed`]
