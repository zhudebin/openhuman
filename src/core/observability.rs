//! `before_send` filters that drop deterministic provider noise:
//! per-attempt transient-upstream failures, budget-exhausted user-state,
//! and transient updater failures.
//!
//! Wraps `tracing::error!` (which the global subscriber forwards to Sentry via
//! `sentry-tracing`) inside a `sentry::with_scope` so each captured event
//! carries consistent tags identifying the failing domain/operation plus any
//! callsite-specific context (session id, request id, tool name, …).
//!
//! Why this helper exists: errors that bubble up as `Result::Err` without ever
//! being logged at error level never reach Sentry. The agent-turn path is the
//! canonical example — `run_single` used to publish a `DomainEvent::AgentError`
//! and return `Err(_)`, but Sentry never saw it. Funnel error sites through
//! `report_error` so they show up tagged and grep-friendly in Sentry.
