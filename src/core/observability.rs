//! being logged at error level never reach Sentry. The agent-turn path is the

///   `"No space left on device (os error 28)"`. The errno-name substring is
///   what we anchor on — case-folded to `"no space left on device"`.
/// - **Windows `ERROR_DISK_FULL` (112)**: `std::io::Error` renders as
///   `"There is not enough space on the disk. (os error 112)"`. Anchor on
///   `"not enough space on the disk"`.
/// - **Windows `ERROR_HANDLE_DISK_FULL` (39)**: same wire text but errno 39.
///   The text anchor already covers it.
///
/// A fourth shape comes from call sites that render the `io::ErrorKind` debug
/// name instead of the `io::Error` Display — notably the auth-profile
/// lock-create annotation, which emits
/// `"... (kind=Some(StorageFull), os_code=Some(28))"` (Sentry TAURI-RUST-4SZ).
/// That string carries no "no space left on device" text, so anchor
/// additionally on the cross-platform `StorageFull` ErrorKind token (std maps
/// ENOSPC / `ERROR_DISK_FULL` / `ERROR_HANDLE_DISK_FULL` all to
/// `ErrorKind::StorageFull`).
///
/// A fifth shape comes from SQLite itself. When the engine detects the
/// disk-full condition during its own page bookkeeping (journal/WAL extension)
/// before the next syscall surfaces an errno, rusqlite renders the `SQLITE_FULL`
/// result code as `"database or disk is full"` (Sentry TAURI-RUST-B6N, hit at
/// `memory_store::unified::documents::tx.commit()` during
/// `openhuman.memory_doc_ingest`). `SQLITE_FULL` has only two causes:
/// genuine ENOSPC/ERROR_DISK_FULL (always the case in practice — the same
/// burst always produces an os-error-28/112 sibling event) or a
/// `max_page_count` PRAGMA cap (we set none).
///
/// The rusqlite `Display` for `SQLITE_FULL` is exactly the five words
/// `"database or disk is full"` — no preamble, no trailing context. Our local
/// memory-store write call-sites wrap it with `format!("<verb>: {e}")`
/// (e.g. `"commit tx: ..."` / `"clear_namespace commit tx: ..."` in
/// `memory_store::unified::documents`), so the phrase always lands as the
/// **suffix** of the local emit. Anchor on suffix, not `contains`, so the

/// happens to mention the same phrase (e.g. an `api.tinyhumans.ai` 5xx whose
