//! Classifier for **provider configuration-rejection** errors.
//!
//! When OpenHuman talks to a user-configured custom cloud endpoint
//! (`custom_openai` → DeepSeek / OpenRouter / Moonshot / …) the upstream
//! API rejects requests whose model id or sampling params it doesn't
//! understand:
//!
//! - `"The supported API model names are deepseek-v4-pro or
//!   deepseek-v4-flash, but you passed reasoning-v1."` (#2079 — an
//!   OpenHuman abstract tier alias leaked to a provider that only speaks
//!   its own native ids)
//! - `"Model 'deepseek-v4-pro' is not available. Use GET
//!   /openai/v1/models to list available models."` (#2202)
//! - `"invalid temperature: only 1 is allowed for this model"` (#2076 —
//!   Moonshot Kimi K2)
//! - `"The model \`gpt-5.5\` does not exist or you do not have access to
//!   it."` / `"model_not_found"` (stale model pin)
//! - `"This model is not available in your region."` (R1 — region-blocked
//!   model on a custom cloud provider)
//! - `"ModelNotAllowed"` (R4 — Doubao/ChatGLM model-allowlist enforcement)
//! - `"invalid_authentication_error"` (YC — user pasted a malformed /
//!   revoked API key into the provider config)
//! - `"This request requires more credits"` (S5 — OpenRouter `402` when
//!   the user's account is out of credits)
//! - `"Insufficient Balance"` (4ZF — DeepSeek custom BYO-key `402` when
//!   the user's DeepSeek account balance is exhausted)
//! - `"Invalid model name passed in model="` (Y0 — litellm-style proxy
//!   rejecting a model id pre-routing)
//! - `"No active credentials for provider:"` (JN / KB — user hasn't
//!   plugged in their API key for the selected provider yet)
//! - `"litellm.BadRequestError"` (JK — litellm github_copilot proxy 400
//!   from a user OAuth/scope gap)
//! - `"not_found_error"` (J2 / J5 / J4 — litellm-compatible envelope
//!   `type` field carrying "model 'X' not found")
//!
//! These are **deterministic user-configuration state**, not bugs the
//! maintainers can act on: the user pointed OpenHuman at a custom
//! provider with a model / temperature / region / credential that
//! provider does not accept. The remediation is "fix the model, key, or
//! routing in Settings", which the UI surfaces. Yet every agent turn
//! produces a fresh Sentry event (OPENHUMAN-TAURI-WJ / -QW / -HB / -NH /
//! -R1 / -R4 / -YC / -S5 / -Y0 / -JN / -KB / -JK / -J2 / -J5 / -J4 —
//! ~250 additional events on top of the Wave 1-3 IDs). This is the
//! same class as budget-exhaustion ([`super::billing_error`]) and must
//! be demoted from Sentry to an info log the same way.
//!
//! ## Provider-aware polarity (important)
//!
//! Most of the phrases below are emitted by **third-party upstream APIs**
//! (DeepSeek / OpenRouter / Moonshot). The OpenHuman hosted backend
//! resolves tier aliases natively and never emits "supported API model
//! names are deepseek-…" or "invalid temperature: only 1 is allowed" — so
//! that phrase set is intrinsically scoped to custom providers. The
//! HTTP-layer wrapper [`super::ops::is_provider_config_rejection_http`]
//! polarity-guards those phrases on `provider !=
//! openhuman_backend::PROVIDER_LABEL` so a model-rejection from our
//! **own** backend that we did not expect (which would be a real
//! regression we sent it a bad request) still reaches Sentry. The
//! message-only predicate is consumed by
//! [`crate::core::observability::expected_error_kind`] for the
//! re-reported error that escapes the provider layer and is raised again
//! by `agent.run_single` / `web_channel.run_chat_task`.
//!
//! **Exception: the OpenAI-compatible "unknown model" shape** (`Model 'X'
//! is not available. Use GET /openai/v1/models …`) is now emitted by the
//! OpenHuman hosted backend too, in response to user-configured model ids
//! that aren't in the backend's registry. Pinned by
//! [`is_openai_compatible_unknown_model_message`]. The HTTP-layer wrapper
//! drops the polarity guard for that specific shape so the same body is
//! treated as user-state regardless of provider — see TAURI-RUST-2Z1
//! where a user-typed `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed` model id (plus two
//! `custom:` fallback variants from their own `model_fallbacks` config)
//! was rejected with this wire shape and otherwise reached Sentry.
//!
//! Keep the list deliberately tight: a false positive demotes a real
//! provider/backend bug to an info log.
