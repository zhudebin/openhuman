//! Shared output formatting for the shell-family command tools (`shell`,
//! `node_exec`, `npm_exec`).
//!
//! # Why this exists (code_executor no-progress loop, #4095)
//!
//! Each shell-family tool previously formatted a FAILED command as
//! `if stderr.is_empty() { stdout } else { stderr }` with no exit code. That
//! lost the two signals the agent most needs to recover:
//!
//!   1. **stdout was dropped whenever stderr was non-empty.** Compilers, test
//!      runners and linters routinely write diagnostics to stdout; the model
//!      saw only stderr and lost half the failure context.
//!   2. **the exit code was never surfaced.** The model could not tell a `127`
//!      (command / dependency not found) or a `126` (permission denied — often a
//!      sandbox restriction) from a generic `1`, so it could not recognise an
//!      un-retryable wall and re-ran the identical command. The harness
//!      repeated-failure circuit breaker (`RepeatedToolFailureMiddleware`, see
//!      `src/openhuman/tinyagents/middleware.rs`) still bounds that loop, but
//!      only after a few wasted iterations and with a generic halt message,
//!      because the root-cause signal had already been thrown away.
//!
//! This module surfaces the exit code AND both streams on failure, and appends a
//! short hint for the well-known dependency/sandbox exit codes so the agent can
//! adapt (install/declare the dependency, request escalation, or report the
//! blocker) instead of retrying blindly. The success path is intentionally left
//! as raw stdout so existing callers that parse a command's output (e.g. `pwd`)
//! keep working unchanged.
