//! Aggregate + validation types for durable agent-team coordination (#3374).
//!
//! The durable row types ([`AgentTeam`], [`AgentTeamMember`], [`AgentTeamTask`],
//! [`ClaimOutcome`]) live in `session_db::run_ledger`. This module adds the
//! read-aggregate view returned by the controllers and the validation error
//! surface used by `ops::assign_task`.
