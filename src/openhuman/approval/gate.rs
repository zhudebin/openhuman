//! `ApprovalGate` — middleware between the agent and any tool whose
//! [`crate::openhuman::tools::Tool::external_effect`] returns `true`.
//!
//! Flow (issue #1339):
//! 1. Agent harness calls [`ApprovalGate::intercept`] with the tool
//!    name, a redacted JSON of the arguments, and a short summary.
//! 2. Gate checks the user's "Always allow" allowlist
//!    (`autonomy.auto_approve`, read live via
//!    [`crate::openhuman::security::live_policy`]). Hit → `Allow`
//!    immediately. An `ApproveAlwaysForTool` decision adds the tool to
//!    that list via `approval_decide` (config save + policy reload).
//! 3. Otherwise: persist a row in `pending_approvals`, publish a
//!    [`DomainEvent::ApprovalRequested`] event so the UI can pop a
//!    toast, and park the call on a `oneshot::Sender` keyed by
//!    `request_id`.
//! 4. UI calls `approval_decide` (RPC) which routes through
//!    [`ApprovalGate::decide`] → sends the decision on the oneshot.
//! 5. The parked future wakes with the decision and translates it
//!    into [`GateOutcome::Allow`] / `Deny`.
//!
//! Sessions: the gate is keyed by an internal per-launch UUID
//! (`session-<uuid>`) used purely for audit grouping. This value is
//! generated unconditionally by the caller (see
//! `bootstrap_core_runtime`) and is never derived from the JSON-RPC
//! bearer token or any other credential material — it is safe to
//! persist and to log. Rows from prior launches are intentionally
//! preserved on init — the issue #1339 acceptance criterion requires
//! they survive restart so the UI can show / dismiss orphans.
//! Decisions on orphan rows update the DB but cannot resume a parked
//! future across processes — no side effect can fire across launches,
//! so the security invariant is preserved without auto-purging.
