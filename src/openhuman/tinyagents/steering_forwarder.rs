//! Abort-on-drop steering forwarder guard (issue #4456).
//!
//! `run_turn_via_tinyagents_shared` bridges OpenHuman's session-owned
//! [`RunQueue`] into a running TinyAgents turn by spawning a 50 ms poll loop
//! that drains queued **steer**/**collect** messages and forwards them into the
//! run's [`SteeringHandle`]. The harness applies them at the next iteration
//! checkpoint.
//!
//! The historical cleanup — `forwarder.abort()` + steering-registry
//! `deregister(...)` — only ran when the drive future returned *normally*. But
//! cancellation in this codebase is **drop-based** (the web channel drops the
//! turn future via a `tokio::select!` cancel token; detached sub-agents are
//! hard-aborted through an `AbortHandle`). On those paths the spawned task
//! *detached* and looped `sleep(50 ms) → drain` forever, pinning the
//! `Arc<RunQueue>` + `SteeringHandle` and — because the `RunQueue` is
//! session-owned and reused — **racing the next turn's forwarder**, stealing its
//! steer/collect messages into a dead handle. Registry entries for aborted
//! sub-agent tasks were likewise never removed.
//!
//! [`SteeringForwarderGuard`] fixes this with RAII: its [`Drop`] aborts the poll
//! task, deregisters from the shared steering registry, and drains any residual
//! (delivered-but-unapplied) steers back into the session `RunQueue` so a late
//! steer becomes the *next* turn's input instead of vanishing. Because the guard
//! is held across the drive future, cleanup happens identically on normal
//! return, error, and drop-cancellation.
