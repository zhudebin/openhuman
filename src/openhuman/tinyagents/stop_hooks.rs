//! Mid-turn stop hooks as a `tinyagents` middleware (issue #4249).
//!
//! openhuman's policy-driven [`StopHook`]s (budget cap, thread-goal budget,
//! ad-hoc iteration ceiling) used to fire between iterations of the legacy
//! tool-call loop. That loop is gone — every turn now runs on the `tinyagents`
//! harness — so the firing point moves into a [`Middleware`]:
//!
//! - [`Middleware::after_model`] accumulates each completed model call's usage
//!   into a per-turn [`TurnCost`] (the same accounting the hooks read), then
//!   evaluates every installed hook with a [`TurnState`] snapshot.
//! - On the first [`StopDecision::Stop`], it sends [`SteeringCommand::Pause`] on
//!   the run's steering handle. The agent loop drains steering at the **top** of
//!   the next iteration (before the next model call) and `Pause` short-circuits
//!   it cleanly — so the run stops before spending another call, returning the
//!   partial transcript. This mirrors the [`CapPauser`](super::CapPauser)
//!   model-call-cap mechanism.
//!
//! The hook list is captured by the caller via
//! [`current_stop_hooks`](crate::openhuman::agent::stop_hooks::current_stop_hooks)
//! while the `CURRENT_STOP_HOOKS` task-local is in scope and handed to
//! [`StopHookMiddleware::new`]; the middleware is only registered when the list
//! is non-empty.
