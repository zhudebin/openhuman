//! Reflection primitive for the proactive subconscious layer (#623).
//!
//! Reflections are the **observation** counterpart to [`super::types::Escalation`]:
//! the LLM emits them at tick time when memory-tree signals warrant attention,
//! but unlike escalations they **never** carry an executable side effect, and
//! (unlike the original #623 design) they **never** auto-post into any
//! conversation thread. Reflections live exclusively on the Intelligence tab;
//! `proposed_action` is a free-text suggestion the user sees as a one-tap
//! button. Tapping it spawns a *new* conversation thread seeded with the
//! reflection's body + action — the existing chat thread is never bloated.
//!
//! The per-tick cap [`MAX_REFLECTIONS_PER_TICK`] guards against runaway
//! emission. Excess reflections are dropped at debug log level.
