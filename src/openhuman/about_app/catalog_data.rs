    //      backend owns the Composio API key, billing, allowlist, and
    //      HMAC-verified trigger fan-out via socket.io.
    //   2. Direct (BYO key) — core calls backend.composio.dev directly
    //      with the user's own key. Sovereign / offline-friendly, but
    //      tool execution only — real-time trigger webhooks are NOT
    //      routed in direct mode (they still require the backend).
