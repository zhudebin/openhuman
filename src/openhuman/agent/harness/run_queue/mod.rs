//! Active-run queue for mid-turn message steering.
//!
//! When an agent turn is in flight, incoming messages can be routed into
//! one of three lanes instead of aborting the turn:
//!
//! - **steers** — injected at the next iteration boundary as a new user
//!   instruction the agent must address immediately.
//! - **followups** — dispatched as a fresh turn after the current one completes.
//! - **collects** — injected as additional context at the next iteration
//!   boundary without being a distinct instruction.
//!
//! The engine drains steers and collects at safe points (after tool results are
//! committed to history), preserving the tool-call / tool-result pairing invariant.
