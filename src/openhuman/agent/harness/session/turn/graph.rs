//! The **chat turn graph** (issue #4249).
//!
//! Per the per-folder `graph.rs` convention, this module owns the chat folder's
//! graph definition, its available tools, and its summarization step — all thin
//! over the shared tinyagents seam
//! ([`run_turn_via_tinyagents_shared`](crate::openhuman::tinyagents::run_turn_via_tinyagents_shared)).
//!
//! **Graph.** The top-level interactive chat turn: a single agent-loop turn
//! driven by the tinyagents harness, observed via the session's `on_progress`
//! sink (live tool timeline, streaming text deltas, cost/token footer) and
//! steerable mid-flight through the session run queue. The loop pauses gracefully
//! at the model-call cap so [`core`](super::core) can emit a resumable checkpoint
//! instead of erroring.
//!
//! **Available tools.** The agent's resolved harness tool set (`tools`),
//! advertised via `SharedToolAdapter`
//! and filtered by `visible_tool_names`. The chat turn surfaces clarifying
//! questions inline rather than pausing, so it advertises **no early-exit
//! tools**.
//!
//! **Summarization.** The caller resolves the model's effective context window
//! and passes it as `context_window`, so the shared seam installs the
//! context-window summarization step (`tinyagents::summarize`) ahead of the
//! deterministic front-trim.
