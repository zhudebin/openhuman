//! Task-local carrier for the **current turn's image-attachment placeholders**
//! (`[Image: … #att:<id>]`), so a delegation to a vision sub-agent can forward
//! the user's attached image into the sub-agent's prompt.
//!
//! The orchestrator runs on a non-vision tier (`chat-v1`): its turn keeps the
//! image as a text placeholder and never rehydrates it (see the image gate in
//! [`crate::openhuman::agent::harness::session`]). When it delegates to the
//! vision sub-agent via `analyze_image`, the sub-agent only receives the
//! orchestrator's text task — not the conversation history. This task-local
//! surfaces the current user message's placeholders to
//! [`crate::openhuman::agent_orchestration::tools::dispatch`], which prepends
//! them to the sub-agent prompt so the (vision-capable) sub-agent's turn
//! rehydrates the image from the on-disk sidecar.
//!
//! Mirrors [`super::model_vision_context`]. Scoped around the orchestrator's
//! turn future (`run_turn_via_tinyagents_shared`);
//! [`current_turn_image_placeholders`] returns an empty vec when no scope is
//! active (CLI / direct invocation / tests) — strictly additive.
