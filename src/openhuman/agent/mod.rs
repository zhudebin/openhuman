//! Agent Domain — multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and session management.
//!
//! This domain owns the core "brain" of OpenHuman. It coordinates how LLMs
//! interact with the system via tools, manages conversation history, and
//! handles autonomous behaviors like trigger triage and episodic memory indexing.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - **[`harness::session::Agent`]**: The primary entry point for running a
//!   conversation. It manages the loop of sending prompts to a provider and
//!   executing the resulting tool calls.
//! - **[`crate::openhuman::agent_registry::agents`]**: Definitions for built-in
//!   specialized agents (Orchestrator, Code Executor, Researcher, etc.).
//! - **[`triage`]**: A high-performance pipeline for classifying and responding
//!   to external triggers (webhooks, cron jobs) using small local models.
//! - **[`dispatcher`]**: Pluggable strategies for how tool calls are formatted
//!   in prompts and parsed from responses (XML, JSON, P-Format).
//! - **[`harness::subagent_runner`]**: Logic for spawning "sub-agents" from
//!   within a parent agent's tool loop, enabling hierarchical delegation.
