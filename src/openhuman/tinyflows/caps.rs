//! The capability seam: five adapters implementing `tinyflows::caps` traits
//! over real OpenHuman services.
//!
//! Each tinyflows integration node hands its **whole** `node.config` to the
//! matching trait method — the adapter interprets a free-form JSON value the
//! flow author wrote, pulling a connection ref out of `config["connection_ref"]`
//! where relevant. See `my_docs/ohxtf/b1-engine-seam-domain/04-capability-seam.md`
//! for the source-verified node → trait contract this mirrors.
//!
//! All host errors are mapped to `tinyflows::error::EngineError::Capability`,
//! per the crate's contract (`caps` traits return `tinyflows::error::Result`).

/// 1. **Full harness turn** (the common case, Phase A). When `agent_ref` names a
///    harness [`AgentDefinition`](crate::openhuman::agent::harness::definition::AgentDefinition),
///    the node builds a real session agent
///    ([`Agent::from_config_for_agent`](crate::openhuman::agent::Agent::from_config_for_agent)
///    + `set_agent_definition_name`) and drives one full turn via
///    [`Agent::run_single`](crate::openhuman::agent::Agent::run_single) — the
///    complete tool loop. The definition's `ToolScope` / `sandbox_mode` /
///    `max_iterations` govern the turn, so an agent node gains its curated
///    toolset with no graph change. This is the same harness pattern
///    `flows_build` / `flows_discover` / cron / subconscious use, so "every node
///    is a tinyagents graph" still holds: `run_single` itself routes through the
///    default agent graph, i.e. a nested tinyagents graph (the agent turn) inside
///    the flow's tinyagents graph.
/// 2. **Persona-shaping completion fallback** (no regression for custom agents).
///    When `agent_ref` only resolves to a custom
///    [`AgentRegistryEntry`](crate::openhuman::agent_registry::AgentRegistryEntry)
///    (no harness definition), the node keeps the original single-completion
///    behavior: the entry's `system_prompt` / `model` are shaped on top of the
///    node request and run through [`OpenHumanLlm::complete`].
///
/// **Security.** No new origin is scoped here: the engine future already runs
/// under the flow's `Workflow` origin (`turn_origin`), so the user's autonomy
/// tier + approval gate apply to the inner turn automatically, and the agent
/// definition's `ToolScope`/sandbox is the inner gate. `agent_ref` is resolved
/// from trusted node config (never model output), so a prompt-injected
/// completion cannot pick an arbitrary agent kind.
///
/// **Per-item cost.** In per-item execution mode the engine calls
/// [`run_agent`](AgentRunner::run_agent) once per input item, so a full harness
/// turn (with memory injection) fans out one `Agent` per item. The batch size is
/// not visible inside a single `run_agent` call (the engine drives the fan-out),
/// so a "> 25 items" warning is not reachable here; it belongs to a future
/// host-side per-item guard. Memory injection per node turn is accepted for this
