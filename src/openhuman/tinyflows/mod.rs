//! The `tinyflows` capability seam: wires the `tinyflows` workflow engine
//! (an external, host-agnostic crate — validate → compile → run on
//! `tinyagents`) to real OpenHuman services.
//!
//! This module is export-focused. The five capability adapters plus the two
//! run entry points — [`build_capabilities`] and [`open_flow_checkpointer`],
//! re-exported below — live in [`caps`]; run observability logging lives in
//! [`observability`]; post-run Langfuse export of a run's durable graph
//! observations lives in [`langfuse_export`]. The `flows::` domain
//! (`src/openhuman/flows/ops.rs`) calls [`build_capabilities`] /
//! [`open_flow_checkpointer`] to drive a run and
//! [`langfuse_export::export_flow_run_trace`] after it settles.
