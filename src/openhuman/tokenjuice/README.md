# tokenjuice

Terminal-output compaction engine. A Rust port of [vincentkoc/tokenjuice](https://github.com/vincentkoc/tokenjuice) that shrinks verbose tool/command output (git, npm, cargo, docker, kubectl, lint, test runners, …) **before** it enters an LLM context window. Given a tool invocation (tool name, argv/command, stdout/stderr, exit code), it classifies the output against a JSON-configured rule set, applies filtering / summarisation / counting transforms, and returns a compacted inline string plus reduction stats. It is a **pure library**: no JSON-RPC surface, no CLI, no persistence, no event bus. The live TinyAgents tool-output middleware calls the policy-aware `compact_output_with_policy` entry point after tool calls.

## Responsibilities

- Normalise a `ToolExecutionInput` (derive `argv` from `command` via a small shell tokenizer when absent).
- Classify the input against a rule set: filter rules by `match` criteria, score by specificity, pick the best (or honour a forced rule id), else `generic` / `generic/fallback`.
- Apply the matched rule's pipeline: pretty-print JSON, strip ANSI, skip/keep line filters, trim empty edges, dedupe adjacent lines, head/tail summarisation, pattern counters, `onEmpty` and output-match canned messages.
- Run special-case post-processors for `git/status` (porcelain rewrite to `M:`/`A:`/`D:`/`R:`/`??`) and `cloud/gh` (JSON-record / table row formatting).
- Failure-aware summarisation: when `exit_code != 0` and a rule has `failure.preserveOnFailure`, use the wider `failure.head`/`failure.tail` window.
- Decide between compacted vs passthrough output (tiny outputs ≤240 chars and file-inspection commands like `cat`/`sed`/`jq` are returned verbatim) and clamp to `max_inline_chars` (default 1200) with end- or middle-truncation.
- Load/compile rules from a three-layer overlay (builtin → user → project), precompiling all regex at load time.
- Provide pass-through-safe agent glue (`compact_output_with_policy` / `compact_tool_output_with_policy`) that only substitutes the compacted text when it is meaningfully smaller (ratio ≤ 0.95 and below 512-byte input is skipped entirely).

## Public surface

Re-exported from `mod.rs`:

- `reduce_execution_with_rules(input, rules, opts) -> CompactResult` — synchronous core pipeline against a pre-loaded rule set.
- `load_builtin_rules() -> Vec<CompiledRule>` — embedded rules only (no disk I/O); `load_rules(&LoadRuleOptions)` for the full builtin/user/project overlay.
- `compact_output_with_policy(content, tool_name, enabled, profile) -> String` — the TinyAgents middleware-facing, pass-through-safe entry point.
- `compact_tool_output_with_policy(tool_name, arguments, output, exit_code, profile) -> (String, CompactionStats)` — the full adapter for call sites that have raw tool arguments and exit code.
- Types: `CompactResult`, `ReduceOptions`, `ToolExecutionInput`, `CompactionStats`, `LoadRuleOptions`.

## Persistence

None at runtime. Builtin rules are embedded at compile time. Optionally reads rule JSON from disk at load time (not written): user layer `~/.config/tokenjuice/rules/` and project layer `<cwd>/.tokenjuice/rules/` (both overridable / skippable via `LoadRuleOptions`). The policy-aware tool adapters use the installed runtime options.

## Dependencies

This module is **fully self-contained within `openhuman`** — it has no `use crate::openhuman::` or `use crate::core::` imports on any other domain or transport module. External crate dependencies only:

- `serde` / `serde_json` — rule and I/O (de)serialisation; gh-output JSON parsing.
- `regex` — rule pattern matching (precompiled at load; thread-local cache for ad-hoc per-line patterns in `reduce.rs`).
- `once_cell::sync::Lazy` — lazy builtin rule cache and the compiled gh table-split regex.
- `dirs` — resolves the user home for the user-layer rules directory.
- `unicode-segmentation` — grapheme-aware width/char counting in `text/width.rs`.
- `log` — verbose `[tokenjuice]`-prefixed diagnostics throughout.

## Used by

- `ToolOutputMiddleware` calls `compact_output_with_policy` after tool calls on the live TinyAgents path.
- The legacy direct executor also calls `compact_output_with_policy` until the old path is removed.

## Notes / gotchas

- **Library-only by design** (v1). No RPC/CLI/store/bus surfaces; the module docstring states they can be layered on later.
- `generic/fallback` rule **must** be present in any rule set — `reduce_execution_with_rules` `expect`s it, and the loader always sorts it last so it never shadows a more specific rule.
- Pass-through safety: the policy-aware adapters return the untouched original (and `stats.applied == false` where stats are available) for inputs < 512 bytes or when compaction ratio > 0.95 — callers never need to guard the call site, and data is never silently lost.
- `git/status` and `cloud/gh` carry **hard-coded** post-processors in `reduce.rs` keyed off `rule.id`, beyond what the JSON rules express.
- JS→Rust regex flag translation: only `i` and `m` are honoured (as inline `(?i)`/`(?m)`); Unicode is always on in Rust's `regex` (no separate `u` flag). Invalid regex in a rule is logged and dropped, not fatal.
- Disk-loaded rule files ending in `.schema.json` or `.fixture.json` are excluded from discovery; symlinks are skipped.
- Vendored rules exclude upstream's `openclaw/` subdirectory (proprietary, non-generic) — see `vendor/README.md`. To add a rule, drop the JSON in `vendor/rules/` (`family__name.json`) and add the `(id, include_str!)` entry to `builtin.rs`.
