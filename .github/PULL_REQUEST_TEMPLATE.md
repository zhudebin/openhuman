- [ ] Coverage matrix updated — added/removed/renamed feature rows in [`docs/TEST-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`](../docs/TEST-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md) reflect this change (or `N/A: behaviour-only change`)
- [ ] All affected feature IDs from the matrix are listed in the PR description under `## Related`
- [ ] No new external network dependencies introduced (mock backend used per [Testing Strategy](../gitbooks/developing/testing-strategy.md#mock-policy))
- [ ] Manual smoke checklist updated if this touches release-cut surfaces ([`docs/RELEASE-MANUAL-SMOKE.md`](../docs/RELEASE-MANUAL-SMOKE.md))
