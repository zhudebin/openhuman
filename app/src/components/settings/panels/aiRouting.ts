 * Reset any workload routing ref pinned to a now-removed provider back to

 * orphaned routing that still points at it.
 *
 * Matching differs by provider kind because routing refs carry different
 * identity:
 * - **Cloud / custom** providers are matched precisely by `providerSlug`
 *   (`{ kind: 'cloud', providerSlug, model }`).
 * - **Local runtimes** (Ollama / LM Studio) have NO slug on their routing refs
 *   (`{ kind: 'local', model }`), so an individual local ref can't be tied back
 *   to a specific runtime. A `local` ref is therefore only definitively
 *   orphaned once NO local runtime remains enabled; while another local runtime
 *   is still enabled we leave `local` refs alone since they may resolve to the
 *   survivor.
 *
 * Before this helper the local case was silently a no-op: the toggle-off
 * handlers only matched `kind === 'cloud' && providerSlug === <runtime>`, which
 * a `kind: 'local'` ref can never satisfy — so disabling Ollama / LM Studio left
 * its routed workloads pinned to a now-removed runtime.
