# Connect OpenHuman to Obsidian

**Goal:** browse and edit the assistant's memory as plain Markdown in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and have your edits flow back into what the agent knows.

OpenHuman's memory isn't a black box: the same chunks the agent reasons over are written as `.md` files in an Obsidian-compatible vault inside your workspace. See [Memory](../features/obsidian-wiki/) for the full picture; this guide just gets you connected.

***

## Prerequisites

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) installed (free).
* OpenHuman set up with at least one source connected, so there's memory to look at — see [Create my personal AI assistant](personal-assistant.md).

## Privacy implications

* The vault is **local** — it lives in your workspace folder (`…/wiki/`) on your machine. Opening it in Obsidian doesn't upload anything.
* Obsidian reads local files directly; no OpenHuman account or backend is involved in browsing the vault.
* Anything you type into the vault becomes part of what the agent can read on its next ingest — treat it like writing into the assistant's memory.

***

## Steps

### 1. Open the vault from OpenHuman

Go to the **Memory** tab and click **View vault in Obsidian**. This opens your `…/wiki/` folder as a vault in Obsidian.

If you'd rather open it manually, point Obsidian at the `wiki/` folder inside your data folder:

| Platform | Vault path |
| -------- | ---------- |
| macOS / Linux | `~/.openhuman/…/wiki/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.openhuman\…\wiki\` |

### 2. Explore the structure

Inside the vault you'll find auto-generated summaries organized by source, topic, and date, plus a place for your own free-form notes. Each summary file carries provenance in its frontmatter so you can trace a claim back to its source. See [Memory Tree](../features/obsidian-wiki/memory-tree.md).

### 3. Add your own notes and links

* Drop in your own Markdown notes.
* Build `[[wiki-links]]` between notes by hand.
* Correct or annotate anything the agent summarized.

### 4. Let the agent pick up your edits

Your changes are read on the next ingest — you don't have to import anything. The agent will see notes you added and links you drew.

***

## Success checks

* [ ] Obsidian opens the vault and shows OpenHuman's summary files.
* [ ] You can open a summary and see source/time provenance in its frontmatter.
* [ ] A note you add by hand is still there after OpenHuman runs (it isn't overwritten), and the agent can reference it in a later chat.

## Common failures

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| Vault opens but is nearly empty | No sources ingested yet | Connect a source and wait an auto-fetch cycle (~20 min); see [personal assistant guide](personal-assistant.md) |
| "View vault in Obsidian" does nothing | Obsidian isn't installed, or the OS couldn't hand off the folder | Install Obsidian, then open the `wiki/` folder manually (paths above) |
| Your edits seem ignored | The next ingest hasn't run, or you edited inside an auto-managed summary block | Give it a cycle; put your own content in your own notes rather than inside generated blocks |

## Recovery

* The vault is just files. If Obsidian shows something odd, close it and reopen the folder — you can't break OpenHuman by browsing.
* If you deleted a note you wanted, the memory database still holds the underlying chunk; the summary can regenerate.
