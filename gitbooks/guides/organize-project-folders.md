  Let OpenHuman tidy, rename, and restructure a folder of files — safely, inside
  a boundary you set, with every change gated by your approval.

# Organize my project folders

**Goal:** point the assistant at a folder and have it clean it up — sort files, rename consistently, remove clutter — without letting it roam your whole disk or make changes you didn't see.

The core idea: the agent works inside a **boundary you define**, and any file change that isn't provably read-only is **parked for your approval** before it runs.

***

## Prerequisites

* OpenHuman set up — see [Create my personal AI assistant](personal-assistant.md).
* A specific folder you want organized. Ideally, make a copy first if the contents are irreplaceable.

## Privacy implications

* File organizing is **local** — reading, moving, and renaming files happens on your machine.
* If you ask the agent to *reason about* file contents (e.g. "group these by topic"), it may send relevant snippets to the model to do that. Route inference to a [local model](local-model.md) if you want that reasoning on-device too.
* The agent cannot touch system or credential folders (`~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, OS directories) — those are blocked outright regardless of settings.

***

## Steps

### 1. Decide where the agent may act

By default the agent's read/write root is its **projects** area (by default `~/OpenHuman/projects`), and it's confined there — it does **not** have ambient access to the rest of your disk. To let it work on a folder elsewhere, add that folder as a **trusted root**:

* Open **Settings → Agents → Agent access**.
* Add the target folder as a trusted root with read-write access.

Keep the boundary as tight as the task — grant the one folder, not your home directory.

### 2. Set the right autonomy tier

* **Supervised** *(recommended)* — the agent proposes each change and you approve moves/renames/deletes as they come.
* **Full** — routine file writes run automatically; still tighten the trusted root so "automatic" stays contained.

Leave the [Approval Gate](../features/approval-gate.md) on. Deleting and moving files are state-changing actions, so they'll be parked for your yes/no.

### 3. Ask for the reorganization

Be concrete about the folder and the rules. For example:

* "In my trusted `~/Documents/receipts` folder, rename every file to `YYYY-MM-DD-vendor.pdf` based on its contents, and move anything older than 2023 into an `archive/` subfolder."
* "Group the loose files in this folder into subfolders by type, and show me the plan before doing anything."

### 4. Review each proposed action

When the agent wants to move, rename, or delete, an **Approval Request card** appears with the exact action. **Approve** one, **Always allow** a repetitive safe one, or **Deny**. You can also just type **yes** / **no**.

***

## Success checks

* [ ] The agent only touched the folder you granted — nothing outside the trusted root changed.
* [ ] Each move/rename/delete showed up as an approval prompt (unless you chose "Always allow" for that tool).
* [ ] The folder matches the structure you asked for.
* [ ] Files you didn't mention are untouched.

## Common failures

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| "I can't access that folder" | The folder isn't a trusted root, or `workspace_only` is confining the agent | Add it in **Settings → Agents → Agent access** as a read-write trusted root |
| It asks for approval on every single file | Supervised tier gates each write | Use **Always allow** for the specific safe tool, or narrow the request so there are fewer actions |
| It refuses to touch a path | The path is a blocked system/credential directory | That's by design — those are never accessible; choose a normal working folder |
| It reorganized more than you wanted | The instruction was broad | Ask it to "show the plan first"; approve selectively |

## Recovery

* **Nothing runs without approval** in Supervised tier — if a plan looks wrong, **Deny** and it doesn't happen.
* **Undo is manual.** OpenHuman doesn't roll file operations back for you, so work on a **copy** of anything precious, or keep the folder under version control (e.g. `git`) so you can revert.
* If the agent is doing too much, drop to **Read-only** in Agent access — it can still suggest a plan but can't change files.
