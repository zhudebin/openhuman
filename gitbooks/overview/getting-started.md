# Getting Started

This page walks you through installing OpenHuman, going through the in-app onboarding, and running your first request.

OpenHuman is open source under the GNU GPL3 license. The codebase is at [github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Want a specific outcome?** If you're here to accomplish something concrete — set up a private assistant, run a local model, recover a broken install, or move to a new machine — the [Guides](../guides/README.md) section has task-by-task walkthroughs.
{% endhint %}

***

## System requirements

OpenHuman runs on **macOS, Windows and Linux** desktops. 4 GB+ RAM is recommended; 16 GB+ if you intend to ingest very large mailboxes or repos, or run a [local model](../features/model-routing/local-ai.md) on the same machine.

### Permissions

The first time you launch OpenHuman, the OS will prompt for the permissions the app needs (Accessibility on macOS, Input Monitoring for the voice hotkey, Camera/Microphone if you plan to use the [Meeting Agent](../features/mascot/meeting-agents.md)). You can review and adjust these any time under **Settings → Automation & Channels**.

***

## 1. Download and install

Get the OpenHuman desktop app from [http://tinyhumans.ai/openhuman](http://tinyhumans.ai/openhuman) or via your platform's package manager. Open the app once it's installed.

## 2. Sign in

The first screen is **"Sign in! Let's Cook"**. Multiple sign-in options are available, including social login. There's also an **Advanced** panel for pointing the app at a custom core RPC URL if you're running your own backend; most users can ignore it.

{% hint style="info" %}
**No permanent lock-in.** Signing in does not grant OpenHuman ongoing access to anything. All third-party access requires explicit OAuth approval per integration in the steps below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Know what is local and what is managed.** Your Memory Tree database, Markdown vault, workspace config, and local runtime state live on your machine. The default setup still uses OpenHuman-hosted services for sign-in, model routing, managed integration OAuth/tool calls, and web search proxying. Use the custom setup paths if you want to bring your own model, search, or Composio credentials. Some hosted features and real-time integration triggers still require the managed backend.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Run your first request

Once Gmail has been ingested (the first auto-fetch tick happens within twenty minutes), try prompts like:

**Briefings**

* "What do I need to know from the last 12 hours?"
* "What's waiting on me?"

**Cross-source queries**

* "Summarize what I missed today."
* "What are the key decisions from this week?"
* "Extract action items from my recent conversations."
* "What did Sarah say about the project across email and chat?"

OpenHuman picks the right model for each task automatically. See [Automatic Model Routing](../features/model-routing/).

***

## 4. Open the Obsidian vault

The Memory tab has a **View vault in Obsidian** button. Click it to open `<workspace>/wiki/` in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). You can browse the agent's summaries, drop in your own notes, and even build manual links - the agent will pick up your edits on the next ingest. See [Obsidian-Style Memory](../features/obsidian-wiki/).

## 5. Let the mascot do more

Now that the agent has memory and a model, the rest of the product is about giving it more surfaces:

* [**Meeting Agents**](../features/mascot/meeting-agents.md) - drop a Google Meet link in and the mascot joins as a real participant: it listens, takes notes into the Memory Tree, speaks back into the call, and uses tools live.
* [**Auto-fetch from Integrations**](../features/obsidian-wiki/auto-fetch.md) - connect more sources from **Settings**; every twenty minutes the scheduler pulls fresh data into your tree.
* [**Native Voice**](../features/native-tools/voice.md) - push-to-talk dictation and TTS replies so you can talk to OpenHuman instead of typing.
* [**Subconscious Loop**](../features/subconscious.md) - let the mascot keep working on standing tasks while you're away.
