Current coverage-related PR checks:

Recent Coverage Gate workflow runs for this branch:
$coverage_runs_summary

Use the GitHub Actions error output for the coverage jobs to identify what is \
failing. Fix the coverage workflow or scripts if they are broken, improve test \
coverage as needed to satisfy the gate, run the relevant local checks, and push \
the fixes back to the PR branch.

After pushing, babysit the PR: monitor the coverage and related required checks, \
investigate any new failures, and keep iterating until the coverage gate is \
green or you hit a real blocker. If you are blocked, summarize the blocker \
clearly with the failing check name, exact error, and what remains to fix."
