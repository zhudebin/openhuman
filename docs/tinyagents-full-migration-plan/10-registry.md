# 10 — CapabilityRegistry projection

One policy-aware lookup over OpenHuman's many registries (agents, tools,
MCP, models, graphs).

Current status (2026-07-02): `agent.graph_topologies` still exposes the
structure-only graph snapshot as JSON-RPC, but the underlying
`tinyagents/topology.rs` helper/report surface is now crate-internal. A full
`CapabilityRegistry` projection remains pending.

Target SDK surface: `CapabilityRegistry` (`register_model`, `register_tool`,
`register_graph_blueprint`, `register_agent`, `register_descriptor`, `alias`,
`snapshot()`, `diagnostics()`, `names_including_aliases()`,
`to_model_registry()`, `to_tool_registry()`, `capability_resolver()`),
`ComponentId`/`ComponentKind`/`ComponentMetadata { id, kind, description, tags,
aliases }`, `RegistrySnapshot` (`to_dot()`),
`RegistryDiagnostic`/`DiagnosticSeverity`, `ModelCatalog`.

## Steps

1. Build-per-run (or cached) `CapabilityRegistry` projection in
   `assemble_turn_harness`: the effective per-turn model/provider profile from
   the assembled turn, tools from the turn's tool sets, graph descriptors from
   the current topology reports
   (delegation/scheduler/member/subagent-pipeline/spawn-parallel), agents from
   both the runtime `AgentDefinitionRegistry` (`agent/harness/definition.rs`)
   and the user-facing `openhuman::agent_registry` default/custom/config
   entries. Wider model route/catalog projection happens earlier from config
   and model routing, not inside `assemble_turn_harness` alone. `.rag`
   `Blueprint` registration comes later when OpenHuman has real blueprint
   artifacts; the current graph exports are structure snapshots, not compiled
   blueprints. `AgentHarness` does not yet expose a registry-replacement setter,
   so `to_model_registry()`/`to_tool_registry()` start as validation/projection
   helpers before they can replace the live `register_model`/`register_tool`
   blocks in `tinyagents/mod.rs`.
2. Diagnostics fail-closed pre-dispatch: duplicate tool names across
   native/MCP/Composio/generated tools, unsafe aliases → registry
   diagnostic errors (today: duplicate handling is scattered across generated
   tools, MCP, and native registration instead of one SDK diagnostic stream).
   TinyAgents 1.5.0 is pinned and exposes `AliasBinding`, alias diagnostics,
   cross-kind name-reuse detection, and `ComponentKind::{Middleware,
Checkpointer, TaskStore, Listener}`; OpenHuman still needs to project those
   SDK diagnostics into its runtime.
3. Introspection RPC: extend the existing `agent.graph_topologies` surface or
   add a sibling RPC for `RegistrySnapshot` (JSON + DOT) so a UI/CLI can show
   every active component.
4. This is also the enabler for `.rag` blueprints later (registry-bound
   capability resolution) — out of scope for this wave, note only.

## Deletions

- Hand-rolled duplicate-name checks scattered in tool assembly (moved to
  diagnostics). Do not delete the live registration glue in `tinyagents/mod.rs`
  until `AgentHarness` can consume the projected registry directly.

## Acceptance

- Duplicate tool name → typed failure before model dispatch (test);
  snapshot RPC lists models/tools/graphs/agents with metadata;
  adapter-inventory test re-pointed at the registry.
